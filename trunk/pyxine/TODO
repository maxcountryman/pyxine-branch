Bug Reports:
   Double xine_config_load()s => segfault
   XINE_DEMUX_REVERT_STRATEGY should be named XINE_DEMUX_STRATEGY_REVERSE in xine.h?
   XINE_STATUS_IDLE never used?
   arts audio driver hangs
   Seeking when playing logo causes segfault.

Refactor player.py, tkplayer.py.  Put common player abstractions

Use OSD in the demo players.

Work some more on the X11Visual API.
