<p>A stupid-bug fix release (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73236">0.1alpha2</a>) is out.  This one might just compile for you!</p>

<p>I've also updated the (still incomplete) <a href="readme.html">README</a> and put it on-line.
(Of course, the updated README didn't make it into 0.1alpha2.)</p>
